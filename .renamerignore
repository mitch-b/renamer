# Renamer ignore patterns
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Blank lines are ignored
# Patterns support gitignore-style globbing

# Built-in essential directories (previously hardcoded)
.git
node_modules

# Build directories
dist
bin
obj

# Cache directories
.cache
tmp
temp

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Custom project-specific patterns
# Add your own patterns below:

# Examples of gitignore-style patterns:
# **/logs/              # Ignore all logs directories recursively
# !**/logs/important.*  # Exception: keep important log files
# **/*.tmp              # Ignore all .tmp files at any depth
